# pmd-py
Useful python app to change power-profiles-daemon modes

## Requirements

- Python
- Python tkinter
- power-profiles-daemon package

## Features

- Simple interface
- Check's the current profile in real time
- Open Source

## Instructions

Run the script using `python3 main.py`

## Why

The reason this exist is that some DEs and WMs do not have a GUI implementatio of `power-profiles-daemon` for example xfce4 and since I like to have GUI option, I made this.
